Homage to blaseball and formula one

Blaseball and formula one are two things I enjoy so I thought it would be fun to combine them. I also felt like it would be an interesting thing to try and code.

## Running

I believe you need npm, elm and parcel installed to run this. If you have all three you should be able to type:

    $ parcel index.html

To see things in action.
